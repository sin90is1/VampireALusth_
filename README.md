Vampire A Lusth is a character module from miximo that I'm using it in ue5
first experience of using Gameplay Ability System. 
fully animated and implemented also using lots of fun niagra particle system ( the Niagara's are from "Niagara Mega VFX Pack vol. 1" that I edited them to fit my scene and game)
abilities are ( Frost Stune Dash (Dash), Frost Beam, Healing arts, Ice Burst, Ice ball, on ground magic circl)
